Its a pretty simple re-color theme for [eDEX-UI](https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui). Added a vignette and the square grids for the background and thats pretty much it.

# How to install

1. Move the two .json files to `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\eDEX-UI\themes`
2. Run eDEX-UI.
3. Press `ctrl+shift+s` on the keyboard to bring up settings.
4. Under `theme` choose either `yorha` or `yorha-notype` depending if you want the on-screen keyboard or not.
5. Click `Save to Disk` and `Reload UI`
6. You should be able to see the theme.
